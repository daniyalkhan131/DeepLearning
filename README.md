# DeepLearning


Deep Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that is inspired by the structure of a human brain.
Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure called Neural Network.


ML is subfield of AI which depends statistical techniques, basically learn things from data
DL Is subfield of ML, in which model is inspired by brain working
